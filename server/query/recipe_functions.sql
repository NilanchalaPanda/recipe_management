/*
Function 1: GET AVERAGE RATING OF A RECIPE
- Purpose: To calculate the average rating of a recipe based on user feedback.
- Problem Statement: Users rate recipes from 1 to 5. We want to display the average rating on the recipe detail page.
- Without Function: Youâ€™d have to write a complex JOIN and AVG() query every time in your application logic.
- Why?: There will be frequent LIKES BY VARIOUS USERS across the application, so making this A FUNCTION WOULD BENEFIT TO AVOID repeatative operations.
